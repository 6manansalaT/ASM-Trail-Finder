# ASM-Trail-Finder
A program that finds the nearest hiking trail or park near you, using your ZIP code. Only Alameda, Fremont, Newark, and Dublin ZIP codes work.

Coordinates for ZIP codes and parks/trails are in memory. The Pythagorean theroem is used with the coordinates of ZIP codes and park/trail 
locations to calculate distances between the two. Using a loop, the minimum distance is found to see which park/trail has the least 
distance between the entered ZIP code.
